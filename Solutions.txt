I just tried it, it recreated the same error, this is the solution for it.

Read below answer, avoid using -f flag. Below method works well. 

This is happen when you try to push initially.Because in your GitHub repo have readMe.md or any other new thing which is not in your local repo. First you have to merge unrelated history of your github repo.To do that

git pull origin master --allow-unrelated-histories
then you can get the other files from repo(readMe.md or any)using this

git pull origin master
After that

git push -u origin master
Now you successfully push your all the changes into Github repo.I'm not expert in git but every time these step work for me.
